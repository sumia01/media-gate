# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Media Gate

Self-hosted, single-binary media management app replacing the Sonarr + Radarr + Overseerr + Prowlarr stack. Go backend + Vue 3 frontend, served as one embedded binary.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go — stdlib `net/http` (Go 1.22+), GORM (SQLite/Postgres), `log/slog`, koanf (config)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript (Composition API), Tailwind CSS v4, Vue Router, embedded via `//go:embed`
- **API contract**: OpenAPI spec in `api/` is the single source of truth — Go server code generated with oapi-codegen v2 (strict server mode), TypeScript client generated with openapi-typescript + openapi-fetch

## Build & Run

```bash
# Full build (generate + frontend + Go binary)
make build

# Run the compiled binary
./media-gate

# Development — Air (Go hot-reload) + Vite (frontend HMR) in parallel
make dev

# Install dev tools (air, oapi-codegen)
make tools

# Code generation only (Go + TypeScript from OpenAPI spec)
make generate

# Frontend build only
make frontend

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Configuration

Configuration loads from `.env` file and/or `MEDIAGATE_`-prefixed environment variables. Config is organized into nested groups (api, db, log, library). Underscore in key names maps to nesting level.

| .env key | Env var | Config field | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `API_PORT` | `MEDIAGATE_API_PORT` | `API.Port` | `8080` | HTTP server port |
| `DB_PATH` | `MEDIAGATE_DB_PATH` | `DB.Path` | `media-gate.db` | SQLite database path |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `MEDIAGATE_LOG_LEVEL` | `Log.Level` | `info` | Log level (debug/info/warn/error) |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `MEDIAGATE_LOG_FORMAT` | `Log.Format` | `text` | Log format (text/json) |
| `LIBRARY_BASEPATH` | `MEDIAGATE_LIBRARY_BASEPATH` | `Library.BasePath` | `/mnt` | Base path for library directories (path traversal guard) |

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Store interface pattern**: All data access goes through a Go `Store` interface with GORM implementations. Business logic never touches the database directly. `WithTx(fn func(Store) error)` wraps multi-step writes in a DB transaction — the callback receives a transactional Store instance.
- **FK CASCADE at DB level**: All child foreign keys use GORM `constraint:OnDelete:CASCADE` (or `SET NULL` for nullable FKs). SQLite FK enforcement via `?_foreign_keys=ON` DSN parameter. Startup migration rebuilds tables missing FK constraints (AutoMigrate can't add FKs to existing SQLite tables). Orphan cleanup runs on every startup. No manual cascade delete code in handlers.
- **OpenAPI-first**: Change the spec in `api/openapi.yaml`, then run `make generate`. Never hand-edit generated code (`internal/api/v1/gen.go`, `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`).
- **Versioned API**: Routes under `/api/v1`, Go code in `internal/api/v1/` (package `apiv1`). Future versions get their own package.
- **Single binary**: The Vue SPA builds into `frontend/dist/`, gets embedded into the Go binary via `frontend/embed.go`. No separate web server needed.
- **go:generate**: `go generate ./...` runs oapi-codegen to regenerate Go server code.
- **Modular frontend**: Components organized by concern — `layout/` for shell pieces, `media/` for domain components, `views/` for route-level pages.
- **Event bus + SSE**: Internal event bus (`internal/eventbus/`) using Go channels dispatches typed events (download lifecycle, library sync/match, media item changes, monitor grabs). Workers and handlers publish events on state transitions. SSE broker (`internal/sse/`) subscribes to all events and streams them to connected frontends via `GET /api/v1/events`. Frontend `useEventStream` composable provides reactive SSE subscription — replaces polling for job status, download progress, and media item updates.
- **Path traversal protection**: All filesystem paths are validated with `filepath.Clean` + `strings.HasPrefix` against `LIBRARY_BASEPATH`. Three enforcement points: library service (Create/Update/Browse), settings service (download path), and importer (torrent file names from qBittorrent API). See ADR-045.

## Development Status

Project has completed **Phase 0** (scaffolding), **Phase 0.5** (frontend layout), **Phase 0.75** (libraries & catalog sync), **Phase 1a** (TMDB/TVDB integration, settings, media matching & job history persistence), **Phase 2** (indexer integration — Cardigann engine, indexer management UI, search results UI, per-indexer seeding rules), and is progressing through **Phase 1b** (core media management), **Phase 3** (download management — Download model + CRUD API, IndexerSearchModal with item/season/episode search, search result season/episode title parsing with match highlighting, episode download status, qBittorrent client adapter with authenticated torrent fetch and file upload, download path + category settings, download queue worker with seeding rules and duplicate handling, downloads section on media detail page with progress/retry/delete/replace and torrent file listing, import worker with hardlink/copy to library and seed cleanup, release folder isolation with companion file import, full delete with torrent/file/empty-dir cleanup, post-import resync and frontend auto-refresh, FK constraint rebuild migration and startup orphan/torrent reconciliation, event bus + SSE refactor replacing polling with real-time push, media item status recalculation based on file presence, path traversal protection with comprehensive test suite, monitor worker with auto-grab for movies and series based on quality profiles and season pack preference setting, atomic Add-to-Library with external episode prefetch and DB transaction via Store.WithTx, configurable worker poll intervals with live settings notification and dynamic ticker reset, typed settings API replacing generic key-value array with explicit fields per setting), and **Phase 4** (multi-copy handling, Library Copies UI for per-release file management via completed download records). See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full plan and `docs/DECISIONS.md` for ADRs.
